You must have missed some steps. Try to follow this

Go to File Explorer then paste this to address bar >> C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application (or just go to where you can find your chrome.exe)
Right click chrome.exe > send to > Desktop (Create Shortcut)
Go to your desktop then find the chrome shortcut you've created.
Rename it to ChromeForTesting (this step is optional)
Right click the shortcut, then Click Properties
At the "Target", paste the following at the end of the link


--user-data-dir=/tmp/foo --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://example.com








"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"  --user-data-dir=/tmp/foo --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://192.168.8.100:3000
